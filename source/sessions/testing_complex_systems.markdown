Thanks for your interest in this tutorial session. Here's some information you
might want to know.


## Topics

We'll be talking about Test-Driven Development. Specifically, we'll be tackling
two hard problems that come up when testing complicated systems:

* Creating data that is easy to set up and robust against model changes.
* Localizing unit tests to only the part of the system that is under test.

Turns out (not to give anything away) that both of these problems get much
easier to manage when you have modular, well-factored code.

Which means that we'll be spending time talking about the real problem:

* How do I use testing to drive me code to a modular and well-factored design?

## Setup

You'll want to start by making sure you have the items in
[Jumpstart Lab's system setup guide](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html)
installed.

This session uses a Rails application. You can find the application and setup
instructions at <https://github.com/noelrappin/rails_conf_travel>. The session
won't use much of the Rails framework, but Rails is a useful backdrop for the
testing topics we'll be covering.
