## Presentation

- [Slides](http://courseware.codeschool.com/how_a_request_becomes_a_response.pdf "Slides")

## Workshop

For our workshop, let's jump into coding with Rails in the browser. If you have not yet completed Rails for Zombies, we recommend running through [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org "Try Ruby") first. Try Ruby should take about 30 minutes to complete. If you've completed Rails for Zombies before, go ahead and start Rails for Zombies 2. *Note:* You will not need to have Ruby or Rails installed on your computer to play these courses.

You likely won't finish an entire course during our session. We recommend working on these courses independently so you can save your progress. 

Aimee and Chris will be available to answer questions!

## Chat

We have a Campfire room set up for you to ask and answer each other's questions during the session.
