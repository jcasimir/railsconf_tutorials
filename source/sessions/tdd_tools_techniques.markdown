We will be building features in a test-driven approach. This is best for
participants who are familiar with Rails and have implemented some basic
features within an application. That being said, all are encouraged to
attend/watch.

For the above reasons, we _strongly_ encourage pairing with someone else during
the workshop. Also, if you see others struggling, please help where possible.

For newcommers to Rails, we recommend checking out the learning resources at our
[Rails trail-map on our Learn Portal][4].

## Smoke Test

Clone the repository and make sure you can run `rspec` from the root of the project:

  expected output
